# Using Alfred in Mac
Alfred is a better alternative for Spotlight app. 
We can search any file and website easily using Alfred.

Snippets, workflows, and syncing are not available in free version.

We can install Alfred 3 from [official website](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

For the usage we can take a look at [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UZ1mHknTiM).
