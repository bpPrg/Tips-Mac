**Installation**:
  - Download service tools and copy them to `~/Library/Services` from [here](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/markdown-service-tools/).
  - Download MultiMarkdown-Mac-3.6 and install it from [this](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/markdown-service-tools/) website. Alternatively we can install it using brew: `brew install multimarkdown`.
  - The detail description of services is explained [here](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/markdown-service-tools/).


**Usage**  
  - Open Mail.App
  - Write some markdown txt
  - seletct the text, right click, services, convert markdown to rtf


**Extra Note**  
To do the similar thing in Chrome Browser, install the plugin `Markdown Here`. Then select all the text and click Markdown here plugin. Note that if we only select some parts and use markdown here, and do it again it fails. First write all the email, and in the end select all the text and use this plugin.

**WARNING**
The tutorial also ask to install service manager app, DO NOT INSTALL IT, it is incompatible with High Sierra.
I tested it on march 3, 2018.
