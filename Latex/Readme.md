### Installing latex in MacOS OS X El Capitan
- By default there was no latex installation on my iMac.
- I tried installing Tex Live Utilities (it says no latexmk installation).
- I tried `brew install latexmk`  and `brew install latex-mk` both failed.

Finally I installed [mactex (2.9GB pkg file)](http://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html).
It gives latex command `latexmk`.

### Using Latex in Atom
- Install packages  `language-latex`, `latex`, `latexer` and `script`.
